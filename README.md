PISA  – Predicting School and Student Success
This project explores the determinants of educational success using the LearningTower dataset, which compiles international data from the OECD PISA studies at the school and student levels. The primary goals are:

To predict whether a given school will improve its performance compared to the national average in future PISA cycles, and to assign a 1–10 “potential” score to each school.

To estimate each student’s probability of achieving a high PISA score based on their personal characteristics, family background, school context, and country-level indicators.

To analyze and interpret the main drivers of educational achievement, offering actionable insights for educators and policymakers.

The project includes:

Data preparation and cleaning of multi-level educational data.

Exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation of model performance (e.g., RMSE).

Discussion of key findings and policy recommendations.

All code is written in R and leverages tidyverse for data processing and visualization.

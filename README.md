PISA  – Predicting School and Student Success
This project explores the determinants of educational success using the LearningTower dataset, which compiles international data from the OECD PISA studies at the school and student levels. 
The projects also use those database:

UNESCO School Gender Enrollment Index
Source: UNESCO, World Bank Data 360
Description:
This dataset contains enrollment indices by gender for secondary and upper secondary education, sourced from UNESCO and curated for this project. It provides an overview of the relative school participation rates for males and females, allowing for the analysis of gender parity and educational equality across countries and over time.

UNESCO Government Expenditure on Education
Source: UNESCO, World Bank Data 360
Description:
This table reports the percentage of total government expenditure allocated to education for each country. It is based on UNESCO data and provides insight into national education priorities and funding trends, which are key contextual factors in the analysis of educational outcomes.

ILO/World Bank Country Groupings (Region, Subregion, and Income Level)
Source: ILOSTAT Country Groupings
Description:
This classification table groups countries by ILO region, subregion, and World Bank income classification (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income). It enables regional and socioeconomic stratification of educational indicators, supporting comparative and equity-focused analysis.


The primary goals of the project are:

To predict whether a given school will improve its performance compared to the national average in future PISA cycles, and to assign a 1–10 “potential” score to each school.

To estimate each student’s probability of achieving a high PISA score based on their personal characteristics, family background, school context, and country-level indicators.

To analyze and interpret the main drivers of educational achievement, offering actionable insights for educators and policymakers.

The project includes:

Data preparation and cleaning of multi-level educational data.

Exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation of model performance (e.g., RMSE).

Discussion of key findings and policy recommendations.

All code is written in R and leverages tidyverse for data processing and visualization.
